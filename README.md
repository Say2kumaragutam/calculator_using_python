# calculator_using_python
First, we need to import tkinter module but syntax " from tkinter import * "  is another way of importing module called as selective importing.
Now, 'win' is a parent window is assigned value as Tk(), we use the Tk () function to create our Tkinter app window in which all the other components are added.(code- win=Tk())
set window geometry. (code- win.geometry(312x324))
use resizable() method to allow Tkinter root window to change itâ€™s size according to the users need as well we can prohibit resizing of the Tkinter window. (code- win.resizable(0,0))
set title to your window. (code- win.title("calculator"))
